# Price-Comparsion

    A program that inputs a product to find the lowest price in websites like Amazon, eBay, and BestBuy. It stores this data in a CSV file. The data will allow to keep a shopping cart of their wanted products.   

### BeautifulSoup:
    
    - A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
    - Works with parser to provide idiomatic ways of seraching and modifiying the parse tree
    - We used BeautifulSoup to extract data (name of product, price, and their image link) from different websites
    - Our goal was to find the lowest price of the given product



### Shopping Cart:

    (1) When we find the result of the product, we saved the data in the CSV file

    (2) You can load the file to see our shopping list so far

    (3) It produces the name, price, and the image of the product
